## Zǎoshang hǎo 👋. I'm Artyom. 

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a frontend developer and a passionate story lover. I'm dedicated to crafting engaging and visually captivating web experiences.

### About Me 👨🏻‍💻

💡 As a frontend developer, I enjoy bringing ideas to life through clean and efficient code. I specialize in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm constantly exploring new frameworks and libraries to improve my skills and stay up to date with the latest trends in web development.

🌱 I believe that great user experiences are at the core of successful websites. I pay attention to both the aesthetics and functionality of my designs, ensuring that they are not only visually appealing but also intuitive and user-friendly.

🎮 When I'm not coding, you can often see me watching anime, reading novels or playing video games. Two of my favorite games are World of Warcraft and Path of Exile.
